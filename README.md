# BTP-Molecular-Communication-and-Machine-Learning

## Overview

This Jupyter notebook simulates the diffusion of molecules in a molecular communication system. It models the number of molecules received by a receiver based on several parameters, including the type of transmitter (spherical, cylindrical, or point), distance, and diffusion coefficient.

The notebook allows for the simulation and visualization of the number of molecules received by a receiver over time and includes a comparison of different transmitter types.

## Notebook Structure

### 1. **Imports & Setup**

   The notebook begins by importing the necessary Python libraries:
   - `numpy` for numerical operations
   - `matplotlib` for plotting graphs
   - `pandas` for data handling
   - `scipy` for mathematical functions
   - `sklearn` for machine learning models
   - `xgboost` for XGBoost regression model

### 2. **Simulation of Molecular Diffusion**

   The core of the notebook simulates the diffusion of molecules and calculates the number of molecules received at the receiver over time. The simulation is based on different types of transmitters (point, spherical, cylindrical).

   The code uses the complementary error function (`erfc`) and error function (`erf`) to model the diffusion process.

   **Steps:**
   - Define parameters for distance, diffusion coefficient, and transmitter type.
   - Calculate the received molecules over time for different transmitter types.
   - Plot the received molecules vs. time for visualization.

### 3. **Model Training & Evaluation**

   The notebook uses various regression models to predict the number of received molecules based on random parameter generation:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
   - XGBoost

   **Steps:**
   - Generate random data for model training.
   - Train each model and evaluate their performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R².

### 4. **Evaluation & Comparison**

   The notebook compares the performance of different regression models. It visualizes the metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, R²) of each model in bar plots.

   **Steps:**
   - Generate performance comparison plots.
   - Show which model performs best based on the evaluation metrics.

### 5. **Conclusion**

   The notebook concludes by analyzing which regression model gives the best prediction for the number of molecules received and discusses the implications of the results.
